[Green Mobility South Tyrol](https://www.greenmobility.bz.it/it/) wants to split the existing functionalities of the website into reusable and independent components. Using these webcomponents, a developer can easily integrate the functionality of the single components into any website.
The data source for the components is the [Open Data Hub](https://opendatahub.com/) project.

## Usage

Include the Javascript file `dist/map_widget.min.js` in your HTML and define the web component like this:

```html
<e-mobility-map-widget></e-mobility-map-widget>
```

### Options

#### Translations

Add `language` as attribute, if you want to translate the web component.

```html
<e-mobility-dashboard-widget language="en"></e-mobility-dashboard-widget>
```

Possible values are currently `en`, `de`, `it`, `nl`, `cs`, `pl`, `fr`, `ru` (see [/src/translations.js](/src/translations.js)).

#### Logo

URL of an icon, that will be shown in the lower left corner.

```html
<e-mobility-map-widget logo="https://www.example.com/your-logo.png"></e-mobility-map-widget>
```

### Styling

This web component has only one style variable, namely
`--e-mobility-widget-map-height`, which sets the height of the widget.

For example:
```html
<style>
  e-mobility-map-widget.YOUR_CLASS_NAME {
    --e-mobility-widget-map-height: 200px;
  }
</style>

<e-mobility-map-widget class="YOUR_CLASS_NAME" logo="logo.png" language="it"></e-mobility-map-widget>
```

The width of this component reacts on regular css rules. Configure the `display`
property accordingly, for instance, as `display: block`, if you want to hardcode
the dimensions.


## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running
on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To build the project, the following prerequisites must be met:

- Node 12 / NPM 8.1.2

For a ready to use Docker environment with all prerequisites already installed and prepared, you can check out the [Docker environment](#docker-environment) section.

### Source code

Get a copy of the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noi-techpark/webcomp-mobility-echarging-map.git
```

Change directory:

```bash
cd webcomp-mobility-echarging-map/
```

### Dependencies

Download all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Build

Build and start the project:

```bash
npm run start
```

The application will be served and can be accessed at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Deployment

To create the distributable files, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Docker environment

For the project a Docker environment is already prepared and ready to use with all necessary prerequisites.

These Docker containers are the same as used by the continuous integration servers.

### Installation

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (with Docker Compose) locally on your machine.

### Dependenices

First, install all dependencies:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app /bin/bash -c "npm install"
```

### Start and stop the containers

Before start working you have to start the Docker containers:

```
docker-compose up --build --detach
```

After finished working you can stop the Docker containers:

```
docker-compose stop
```

### Running commands inside the container

When the containers are running, you can execute any command inside the environment. Just replace the dots `...` in the following example with the command you wish to execute:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app /bin/bash -c "..."
```

Some examples are:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app /bin/bash -c "npm run build"
```

### License

The code in this project is licensed under the GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 license. See the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for more information.

### REUSE

This project is [REUSE](https://reuse.software) compliant, more information about the usage of REUSE in NOI Techpark repositories can be found [here](https://github.com/noi-techpark/odh-docs/wiki/Guidelines-for-developers-and-licenses#guidelines-for-contributors-and-new-developers).

Since the CI for this project checks for REUSE compliance you might find it useful to use a pre-commit hook checking for REUSE compliance locally. The [pre-commit-config](.pre-commit-config.yaml) file in the repository root is already configured to check for REUSE compliance with help of the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) tool.

Install the tool by running:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
```
Then install the pre-commit hook via the config file by running:
```bash
pre-commit install
```
